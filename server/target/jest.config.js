// workaround for pnpm which generates NODE_PATH into node_modules\.bin\*.cmd files
// - without it debugging wouldn't work because the resolving of files would behave differently when
// run via "npm test" (cmd line) vs. "node node_modules\...\jest-cli\bin\jest.js" (IDE debug)
// jest config generated by uuApp devkit has been removed as part of uuApp cleanup.
